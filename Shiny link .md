Final Project

The dataset being used is called Washington Offense Type by Agency 2020. This dataset was collected by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) using the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS). It contains data for 120 cities in Washington state on 60 different types of crimes.There is a chance that there may be some inaccuracies since the data is taken through human input of the police officers contributing to NIBRS. However, the dataset comes from a reliable source, as it is collected by the government.

The target audience are residents of Washington State wanting to know how safe their area is, relative to how many crimes were committed, and what types of crimes were committed. The target audience can also be people who are looking to move in/out based on how safe the area is. This app targets users who would want to see visually how other cities/areas are safe compard to eachother as well as what crimes are normally committed, and the frequency of the offense. Police can also use this website to see the summary of crime for 2020, which can help decide if they need to make decisions on funding etc.
                        
Our website visualises data for users. Our plots include, danger levels of each city in WA, table that sorts the highest/lowest cities for each column, a scatter plot on population vs. total offenses, and a bar chart showing a city's ratio between population and different types of crimes.
